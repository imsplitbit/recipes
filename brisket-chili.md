# Brisket Chili

## Ingredients
1 can pinto beans
1 can black beans
1 can kidney beans
1 lb ground beef browned
2 lbs of brisket scraps
2 30oz cans of tomato sauce
2 15oz can of fire roasted diced tomatoes
4 small cans of mild chilies (heres where you can play with the spice a bit, if it's not for kids I will use hatchor aneheim peppers here)
1 large white onion diced
2 tbs of diced garlic (I eyeball it but it's roughly 2-3)
Cumin
Paprika
Chili Powder
Salt
Pepper

## Instructions
For the comino, paprika, and chili powder I essentially just coat the surface of the chili and then stir it in and taste. if you want less spicy use less chili powder and more paprika.
The salt and pepper I'd say maybe 2 teaspoons and then add more to taste
Dump all that in a large slow cooker and put it on high for 4 hours, it's usually ready to eat after 3 but 4 is better to really mix all the flavors.
