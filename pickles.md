# Refrigerator Pickles
Refrigerator or "Day" pickles are quick pickles that aren't made in such a way that they're preserved for years but the tradeoff is you have pickles that are quick and easy to make.  If kept refrigerated they will last for several weeks.

# Brine
## Ingredients
2 cups water
2 cups distilled white vinegar
3 tablespoons pickling salt
3 teaspoons dill seed
1 teaspoon mustard seed
1 teaspoon celery seed
2 teaspoons korean pepper flakes

## Instructions
0. To make the brine combine all ingredients in the pot.
0. Bring to a boil and immediately remove from heat.
0. Cool until room temperature.

# Cucumber / Jar Prep
## Ingredients
9 - 10 large pickling cucumbers (~3 per jar)
3 teaspoons korean pepper flakes (1 per jar)
3 teaspoons dill seed (1 per jar)
6 large whole garlic cloves (2 per jar)

## Instructions
0. Cut the cucumbers into spears lengthwise.
   * I do this by cutting them into eighths because it makes it easier to pack them all in.
0. Peel the garlic cloves
0. Score the garlic cloves all over to allow more flavor to get out
   * You can also just crush them.
     * I like to score them because it keeps them whole and makes for tasty pickled garlic later on down the road.
0. Drop 2 garlic cloves into each jar.
0. Fill the 3 jars with the cucumber spears.
   * It helps to shake the jar a little bit as you fill them.
0. Add 1 teaspoon of korean pepper flakes to each jar.
   * Use less if you don't like spicy things.
0. Add 1 teaspoon of dill seed to each jar.
   * Think of this like dry hopping a beer, if you don't like a stong dill flavor, skip it.

# Final assembly
## Instructions
0. Place the canning funnel over the jar.
   * If you're not going to use the cheese cloth to filter out the brine cruft you don't have to use this.
0. Place the fine cheese cloth over the funnel and push it down into the funnel.
   * This is to filter out the cruft from the brine that tends to be sludgy, you can skip this if you don't mind the sludge.
0. Pour the brine into the jar over the cucumber spears and leave ~1/2 inch of head space.
0. Cover and refrigerate.
0. The pickles are ready in 24 hours.
